# homework 1 


# question 1: 
# step 1: update the code
# stpe 2: select the updated files under the top right window under "git" and click push
# step 3: enter the user name and token to log into github and click push. 


# question 2:
a<- c(1,2,3,4,5)
b<-c(6,7,8,9,10)
c<-c(11,12,13,14,15)
a+b
b+c
b*c

## if the vector sets vary in length then unable to do calculation
#d<-c(1,2,3)
#a+d
#Warning message: In a + d : longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length
